      "description": "Rules are a list of RateLimit selectors and limits. Each rule and its associated limit is applied in a mutually exclusive way. If a request matches multiple rules, each of their associated limits get applied, so a single request might increase the rate limit counters for multiple rules if selected. The rate limit service will return a logical OR of the individual rate limit decisions of all matching rules. For example, if a request matches two rules, one rate limited and one not, the final decision will be to rate limit the request.",
