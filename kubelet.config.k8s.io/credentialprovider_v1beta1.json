If one of the strings matches the requested image from the kubelet, the plugin will be invoked and given a chance to provide credentials. Images are expected to contain the registry domain and URL path.\n\nEach entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path. Globs can be used in the domain, but not in the port or the path. Globs are supported as subdomains like '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io', and top-level-domains such as 'k8s.*'. Matching partial subdomains like 'app*.k8s.io' is also supported. Each glob can only match a single subdomain segment, so *.io does not match *.k8s.io.\n\nA match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true: - Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches. - The URL path of an imageMatch must be a prefix of the target image URL path. - If the imageMatch contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.\n\nExample values of matchImages:\n  - 123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n  - *.azurecr.io\n  - gcr.io\n  - *.*.registry.io\n  - registry.io:8080/path",
