HTTPRouteFilters are meant as an extension point to express processing that may be done in Gateway implementations. Some examples include request or response modification, implementing authentication strategies, rate-limiting, and traffic shaping. API guarantee/conformance is defined based on the type of the filter.",

Filter-specific configuration for such filters\n  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to\n  \"ExtensionRef\" for custom filters.\n\nImplementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.\n\nIf a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped.
