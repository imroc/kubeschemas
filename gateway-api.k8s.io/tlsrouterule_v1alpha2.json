If unspecified or invalid (refers to a nonexistent resource or a Service with no endpoints), the rule performs no forwarding; if no filters are specified that would result in a response being sent, the underlying implementation must actively reject request attempts to this backend, by rejecting the connection or returning a 500 status code. Request rejections must respect weight; if an invalid backend is requested to have 80% of requests, then 80% of requests must be rejected instead.\n\nSupport: Core for Kubernetes Service\n\nSupport: Extended for Kubernetes ServiceImport\n\nSupport: Implementation-specific for any other resource\n\nSupport for weight: Extended",
