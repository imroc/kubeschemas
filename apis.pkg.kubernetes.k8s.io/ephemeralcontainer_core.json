Ephemeral containers have no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the Pod to exceed its resource allocation.\n\nTo add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing Pod.
