This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label. It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods. Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their CSIDriver instance.
